## Components

 - [Generator](./README-generator.md): Get a signed SSL certificate in the command line from scratch in less than a minute
 - [Downloader](./README-downloader.md): Download ZeroSSL certificates in any format which might be required
 - [CSR Tool](./README-csrtool.md): Advanced tool for CSR generation (under construction)

## Errors

The script will display native PHP errors with the stack trace in case something goes wrong. In order
to understand what is not working check the first line of the error output. Most likely
you will have a `ConfigurationException`, which means you have to adjust your input.

## Usage as a library

Note: This is not yet completely ready, be free to make MRs for improvement.

### Including in custom PHP scripts

Create an options object: `$options = new ZeroSSL\CliClient\Dto\Options()`

Run: `$certificateData = RequestProcessor::generate($options,true);`

Have a look at the RequestProcessor objects for the functions you need to achieve what you actually want.
